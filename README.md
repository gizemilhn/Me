# Me
 Hi my name is Gizem. I study Informational System Engineering at Kocaeli University.
 As a curious and eager-to-learn Computer Engineering student, I am dedicated to continuously improving myself in web development using the Laravel framework. I strive to enhance my competencies by researching more about various hardware technologies. I am open to learning about task prioritization and aim to develop my critical thinking and effective teamwork skills to contribute to the development of industrial web applications.
